# Step by Step Install

**Step 1** go to this link - (https://github.com/CodeKenjie/InventoryApp/releases/tag/v1.01)

**Step 2** install the (.zip or tar.zip) file it will install a zip file

**Step 3** unzip the file or just pick the intaller you need for your OS 
- for Windows(.exe) 
- for MacOS(.dmg)
- for Linux (.deb)

this will install the file and i believe it should make a shortcut in your Start Menu (Sorry this is my first time releasing an app, so im not sure about most of the things)

**Step 4** Use the Your inventory system :)

thats all thank you very much
