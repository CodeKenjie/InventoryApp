# Step by Step Install

**Step 1** Make sure to install the jdk - https://download.oracle.com/java/25/latest/jdk-25_windows-x64_bin.exe

**Step 2** go to this link - (https://github.com/CodeKenjie/InventoryApp/blob/main/target/InventoryApp-1.0.jar)

**Step 3** click the menu button or the (...) in the topright corner then click download it will be installed then you can use it freely

**Step 4** if you followed all the Steps and Install everything you need to install it should work fine, **i just tried it -_-**

side note you can place it in a folder of your choosing and create a short cut to your desktop, just so you can keep the database file in another folder and not in your desktop, but if you dont mind your .db file in desktop then no need for this extra steps. thats all thank you.

***one more thing if you already have an existing .db file from the previews version then you can place the InventoryApp-1.0.jar in the same location just so it can read the old .db file.***

I will try making it a stand alone app where you wont need to install java or sqlite and probably put an icon and make it like and actual app, I'll just keep you updated :)

Thats all thank you very much
