# Step by Step Install

**Step 1** go to this link - (https://github.com/CodeKenjie/InventoryApp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

**Step 2** install a zip file it will install a zip file

**Step 3** Make sure to install the jdk - https://download.oracle.com/java/25/latest/jdk-25_windows-x64_bin.exe **and** sqlite-tools-win-arm64-3510000.zip **at** https://sqlite.org/download.html

**Step 4** unzip the file in your Program Files at your local disk

**Step 5** inside InventoryApp file you can see the Inventory.jar (now you can make a shortcut and put it in your desktop so you can access the app easily);

**Step 6** if you followed all the Steps and Install everything you need to install it should work fine, **i just tried it -_-**

I will try making it a stand alone app where you wont need to install java or sqlite and probably put an icon and make it like and actual app, I'll just keep you updated :)

Thats all thank you very much
